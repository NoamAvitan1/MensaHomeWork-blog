run "npm start" for running the application

Hi Toluwani,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to apologize for missing the test yesterday. Unfortunately, I was away for the Passover holiday and didn't check my email during that time.

I understand the importance of the test and the impact of my absence. I'm committed to making up for it and ensuring that it doesn't happen again in the future. If there's anything I can do to help catch up or contribute in any way, please let me know.

Once again, I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused, and thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
Noam Avitan.
